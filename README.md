# Bayesian Model of Ad-hoc Role Specialization

This repository hosts our work on a research paper investigating a Bayesian model of ad-hoc role specialization.

## Repository Structure

### `cogsci_paper/`
Contains the Typst template for the paper submission itself. This includes the manuscript and formatting for conference submission.

### `computational_model/`
Contains the computational model of our agents playing the game. This implements the Bayesian model of role specialization behavior.

### `human_experiment/`
Contains the human experiment being built with Empirica. This folder includes the experimental platform for collecting behavioral data from human participants.
